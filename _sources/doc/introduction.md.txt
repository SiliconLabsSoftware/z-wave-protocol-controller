## Overview

Z-Wave-Protocol-Controller is a software framework that simplifies the developer experience, removing difficult parts of network control and network management as it relates to gateway and hub development in IoT applications.

Z-Wave-Protocol-Controller is developed as an open, modular, and portable architecture based on ubiquitous lightweight MQTT technology. The software framework is designed and developed on Linux. It provides an extensible set of software features to enable IoT wireless connectivity in gateways, multiprotocol scalability and application processor-based end products. Z-Wave-Protocol-Controller simplifies development and ongoing software maintenance for IoT gateways and application processor-based end devices.

The Z-Wave-Protocol-Controller provides software source and binary packages for Raspberry Pi 4. 

Z-Wave-Protocol-Controller provides common building blocks that ease connectivity across IoT ecosystems.

When developing IoT products that leverage a Linux operating system and a
Silicon Labs radio, such as an IoT gateway or an advanced IoT end device,
additional software is needed to interface with the IoT radio and provide
interoperability with the host application. To equip customers developing
complex IoT applications for single or multi-protocol use cases, Silicon Labs
has created a single repository for important customer software needs on a Linux
gateway. We've aggregated software from multiple repositories and simplified the
distribution to enhance ease of use and accessibility.

The Z-Wave-Protocol-Controller contains:

* The Unify Framework - A powerful IoT gateway framework that can support multiple wireless protocols.
* Protocol Controllers that implement various wireless protocols.

Here is a component view along with further detailed descriptions below.
