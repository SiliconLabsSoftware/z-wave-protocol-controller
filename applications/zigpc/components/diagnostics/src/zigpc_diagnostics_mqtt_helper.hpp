/*
HOW-TO and class relationship of diagnostic manager :
The goal of this component is to receive and send diagnosis information via mqtt

This component is composed of three parts, the manager, the metrics and a mqtt helper.

The manager :
  -Contains all the metric in a map
  -Receives request as a string of metric array from mqtt_helper
  -Ask the relevant metrics to update their values and notify back the manager
  -Publishes the resulting information under the correct unid and topic

The Metric :
  - Are derived from the base metric classes
  - Get relevant information and then notify the manager that the info is ready
  
The MQTT Helper
  -Contains the process which handles request
  -Initialises the whole component on a network init event
  -Is used to add all metrics in the map in the initialisation
  -Subscribes to the correct request topic
