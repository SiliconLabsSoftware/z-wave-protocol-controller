 * @brief zwave_controller callbacks registration system.
 *
 * This modules routes events from the Z-Wave Controller sub-blocks (such as
 * Z-Wave RX or network management) and dispatches them to other components that
 * have registered a callback for this particular event. Refer to @ref
 * zwave_controller_register_callbacks
 *
 * <b>Example usage:</b>
 * <DIV>
 * <CODE>
 *    zwave_controller_callbacks_t my_callbacks = {NULL};<BR>
 *    my_callbacks.on_new_suc = my_on_new_suc_function;<BR>
 *    zwave_controller_register_callbacks(my_callbacks);<BR>
 * </CODE>
 * </DIV>
 * After this, my function will now be called when the SUC NodeID changes.
 * Changing the list of functions to invoke can be done runtime:
 * <DIV>
 * <CODE>
 *    my_callbacks.on_node_information = my_on_node_information_function;<BR>
 *    my_callbacks.on_new_suc = NULL;<BR>
 * </CODE>
 * </DIV>
 * The user component must de-register callbacks if the variable is to be destroyed
 * <DIV>
 * <CODE>
 *    zwave_controller_deregister_callbacks(my_callbacks);<BR>
 *    // Now my_callbacks can be destroyed
