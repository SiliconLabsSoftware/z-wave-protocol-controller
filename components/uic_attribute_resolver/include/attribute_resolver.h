/**
 * @defgroup attribute_resolver Attribute Resolver
 * @ingroup unify_components
 * @brief The role of the attribute resolver is to locate and resolve missing
 * information in the attribute store.
 *
 * The role of the attribute resolver is to try to fetch missing information and
 * align reported and desired values in attributes. It does so by holding a rule
 * set for attributes. Two hooks rules are allowed pr attributes,
 *
 * - A rule on how to bring the attribute desired value to the reported value. This
 *   typically maps to sending a SET command. Several rules could map to the same
 *   set command. In other words, if multiple attributes exist in the set. When
 *   the SET command is executed, it is filled with the desired value of the
 *   attribute that make up the set command.
 * - A rule on how to trigger a reported updated of an attribute, i.e., if the
 *   attribute is unresolved. This rule typically maps to a GET command.

 *                             fully resolved.
 * - SL_STATUS_ALREADY_EXISTS: The Attribute was solved using some
 *                             calculation/deductions from the Attribute Store
 *                             and no frame needs to be transmitted.
 * - SL_STATUS_IS_WAITING:     The Attribute should not be resolved and should be

 * - SL_STATUS_FAIL: (or other codes) No frame was copied due to an error.
