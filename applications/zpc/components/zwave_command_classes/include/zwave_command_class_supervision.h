 * @defgroup zwave_command_class_supervision Supervision Command Class
 * @ingroup command_classes
 * @brief A Z-Wave Supervision Command Class handlers and control functions
 *
 * This module provides both support and control of the Supervision Command Class.
 * It is composed of the following two submodules:
 * - @ref zwave_command_class_supervision_handler
 * - @ref zwave_command_class_supervision_process
 *
 * The handler parses incoming Get and Report Command
 * and provides an API to send Supervision encapsulated frames.
 *
 * The process keeps track of controlled Supervision Sessions
 * and time out waiting for status reports.
 *
 * A frame transmission is illustrated in the following figure:
 * \image html zwave_command_class_supervision.png "Supervision send data example"
 *
 * And a frame transmission with a missing Supervision report is
 * illustrated in the following figure:
 * \image html zwave_command_class_supervision_timeout.png "Supervision send data with timeout example"
