# QR-Code Scanner

## This scanner allows you to extract DSK from Z-Wave QR-code.

Scan the QR-code of your device. If the scan is successful, the DSK will appear under the scanner. Copy it and paste it into the DSK field on the SmartStart page of Unified IoT Controller.
If the code format is different from Z-Wave QR-code, you will see an error message.
