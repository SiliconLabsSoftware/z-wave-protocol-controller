 *                        sent to a group MUST have been registered with

 * @param frame_size      Size of the payload carried by the Frame pointer.
 * @param supporting      Set to true if the frame we send is supported
 *                        (i.e sent at our highest security level).
 *                        False for a controlling frame.
 * @param tx_options      Pointer to zwave_tx_options for the transmission.
 * @param excluded_node   NodeID to exclude from the group (e.g. if lifeline
 *                        true status is to be reported to everyone but the
 *                        NodeID that triggered the change.) Set to 0 for

 * @param callback        Callback to invoke when all transmissions for all
 *                        destinations are completed/failed.
 * @param user            User pointer for the callback.
 *
 * Note that no abort function is provided. Set the discard timeout to a low
 * value in the tx_options if you do not want a transmission to take too long.
 *
 * @returns SL_STATUS_OK if the frame(s) were queued and callback will be
 *          called when all transmissions are done. SL_STATUS_NOT_FOUND if the

 *          SL_STATUS_FAIL in case of error.
