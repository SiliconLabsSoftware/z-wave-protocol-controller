This tag was added once CI was able to produce unsupported binaries:

https://github.com/SiliconLabsSoftware/z-wave-protocol-controller/releases/tag/ver_1.6.0-RC4

Please prefer UnifySDK assets, linked in previous chapter.


## ver_1.6.0-RC0

The initial import of this project, is coming from latest release of
UnifySDK:

https://github.com/SiliconLabs/UnifySDK/releases/tag/ver_1.6.0

This tag is marked as RC0 because it won't be supported in this
downstream repostiory.

Sources should be mostly same as above:
