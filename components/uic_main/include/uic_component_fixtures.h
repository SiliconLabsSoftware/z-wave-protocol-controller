/** \defgroup uic_fixt Unify Component Fixture Set Up and Tear Down
 *
 * \ingroup uic_main
 *
 * A fixture is the environment a component runs in.  So it must be
 * set up before the component can work and maybe also cleaned up
 * afterwards.
 *
 * In the Unify Framework, most of what the components need are provided by other
 * components or by the Contiki OS.
 * However, there are key features that are needed by a few of the
 * components and that are not provided by Unify itself.  This may
 * relate to external interfaces or dynamic memory.
 *
 * If a component needs to set up and/or tear down such a resource, it
 * can install an initializer (the set-up function).
 * If the component is in the Unify library, this shall be done in \ref
 * uic_fixt_setup_steps_list array and a tear-down function in the \ref
 * uic_fixt_shutdown_steps_list array.
 * If the component is outside the Unify library an array of
 * \ref uic_fixt_setup_step_t and \ref uic_fixt_shutdown_step_t
 * are added to \ref uic_main function call.
 *
 * A tear-down function may also be useful for releasing allocated resources.
 *
 * <b> Order of Execution </b>
 *
 * The set-up functions are executed as the first thing after the
 * configuration settings have been read and the logging system
 * has been initialized.
 *
 * Tear-down functions are run after the \ref uic_main_loop() has
 * terminated and after the Contiki OS is terminated, i.e., there are
 * no processes and no Contiki timers.
 *
 * \note If any of the set-up functions fail, the whole system will
 * fail to start and the tear-down functions will not be called.

/** Type of a component fixture set-up function.

 *
 * The function should returns SL_STATUS_FAIL if the Unify GW cannot start
 * due to an error. If the component whish to abort the boot sequence
 * but not due to an error SL_STATUS_ABORT should be returned. If the
 * component failed in a non-critical way or is optional, 
 * SL_STATUS_NOT_AVAILABLE should be returned. If boot should proceed 
 * normally SL_STATUS_OK should be returned
