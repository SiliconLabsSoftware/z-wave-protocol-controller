 * @brief Z-Wave Controller Transport Framework.
 *
 * The purpose of the Z-Wave Controller Transport Framework, is to have a simple
 * API witch handles integration of all Z-Wave transport command classes. Each
 * encapsulation command class will register its command handlers and send
 * data function to the controller. The controller module will make sure that
 * the right handler will be executed when appropriate.
 *
 * Each transport can be single session when sending.
 *
 * All transport must use the @ref zwave_tx_send_data function when sending
 * frames. It is important the the transport handlers use the
 * zwave_tx_parent_session_id parameter in zwave_tx_options_t when sending
 * frames.
 *
 * When a frame is de-encapsulated it must be forwarded using the @ref
 * zwave_controller_on_frame_received function.
